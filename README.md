- ğŸŒ· Ciaooo! I am @irijuju.  My name is Rahme and I am a 20 year old female computing student.
- ğŸŒ™ I am interested in website development, specifically making websites pretty. 
- ğŸŒ· Iâ€™m currently learning C, javascript, PHP, and SQL.  I am learning at University and I am a beginner in my first ever year learning.
- ğŸŒ™ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on website projects maybe in the future web-based extensions.
- ğŸŒ· How to reach me: @sniezkaaa on discord.
- ğŸŒ™ I am neurologically sick so I struggle to keep physially intense or people focussed jobs and I hope I will be able to one day sustain from this and painting as a freelance artist.
